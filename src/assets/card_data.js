        Aim: "Stroke, a leading cause of death. Its impact can be devastating, affecting memory, and other vital functions. However, the critical window for effective treatment is narrow, making early detection absolutely crucial.",
        Model: "Utilizing a publicly accessible patient dataset, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to discern critical factors for predicting strokes. By transforming the feature space from higher to lower dimensions, we gain insights into the relative significance of each input attribute.",

        Title: "Lung Cancer Predictor",
        Aim: "Early detection, when the cancer is localized and hasn't spread, significantly increases the chances of successful treatment and survival. Five-year survival rates for early-stage lung cancer can be as high as 90%, compared to only 5% for advanced stages",
        Model: "We have achieved a 97% accuracy rate in diagnosing two common types of lung cancer by analyzing tissue sample slides.",
